# ImitateOSByCocos
There are three projects and each or them is done by cocos2d-x. What's more, cocos-2d is just a tool, with which I finish the simulation 
of how the operating system works.
The FileSystem project simulates how the file system of our operating system works.
The Page project simulates the page machanism of the operating system.
The ProducerAndCosumer project simulates how the processes run in the operating system.
All the projects were finished at the second semester of grade two at Tongji University.
All the projects are finished by myself.
I'm happy to share my works with you!
